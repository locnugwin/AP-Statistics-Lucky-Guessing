# Lucky guessing?
---
A problem taken from the textbook *Stats Modeling The World* 
that I used while I was taking AP Statistics. The problem 
builds upon a question asked prior in regards to taking a
multiple choice quiz with six questions.

The question that I decided to write a Python program for is
the following: 

> A friend of yours who took the multiple choice quiz in 
> Exercise 19 got all 6 questions right, but now claims to 
> have guessed blindly on every question. If each question 
> offered 4 possible answers, do you believe her? Explain, 
> basing your argument on a simulation involving at least 10 
> trials.
