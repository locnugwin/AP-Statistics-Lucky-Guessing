# Lucky guessing?
---
This program is meant to solve a problem taken from the 
textbook *Stats Modeling The World* that I used while I 
was taking AP Statistics. The problem  builds upon a 
question asked prior in regards to taking a multiple choice 
quiz with six questions.

The question is the following: 

> A friend of yours who took the multiple choice quiz in 
> Exercise 19 got all 6 questions right, but now claims to 
> have guessed blindly on every question. If each question 
> offered 4 possible answers, do you believe her? Explain, 
> basing your argument on a simulation involving at least 10 
> trials.

For context, the question that preceded is as follows:
> You take a quiz with 6 multiple
> choice questions. After you studied, you estimated that
> you would have about an 80% chance of getting any indi-
> vidual question right. What are your chances of getting
> them all right? Use at least 20 trials.
